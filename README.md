1)#FvsA.py 
This is an anomotised version, and rewritten manually, of a script I generated at work. It compares two data sets of derivative trades. It's numerical data of various different greeks. We are comparing the output of system 1 vs the output of system 2
2) Adjustment Review
Dummy data of a sample of types of adjustments made to specific derivative fair values to statisfy a regulator inquiry. Adjustments for 'Time' should be neutral over time, with a mean around close to $0. Where they aren't, fair values are being artificially provisioned, indicating there's a model valuation issue. The data here is completely fake.
